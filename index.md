Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! I'm currently a Sophomore at MIT pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science. Keep scrolling to find out about some of my past personal projects! 

## Projects
**Custom 3D printed Watch**

Designed my own custom watch in SolidWorks. Printed it on a MonoPrice Mini printer. Retro fit the housing with an existing watch strap. The watch movement is intentionally exposed so that the viewer can appreciate the inner mechanism.

**DC Brushless Motor**

Designed and built a brushless DC motor from scratch. Used SolidWorks to CAD an assembly which I then fabricated. Laser cut the acrylic parts and made my own electromagnets by winding copper wire around a ferrite core. The motor has two main components: a shaft with four permanent magnets and the six electromagnets. The six electromagnets are wired to and controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Using Python, I programmed the electromagnets to sequentially attract and repel the permanent magnets located in the shaft. This causes the motor to spin.

### Education

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bmorioka/branden.morioka.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bmorioka/branden.morioka.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
