Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! I'm currently a Sophomore at MIT pursuing a BS in Mechanical Engineering & Computer Science. Keep scrolling to find out about some of my past personal projects! 

## Projects
## Custom 3D printed Watch

Designed my own custom watch in SolidWorks. Printed it on a MonoPrice Mini printer. Retro fit the housing with an existing watch strap. The watch movement is intentionally exposed so that the viewer can appreciate the inner mechanism.

## DC Brushless Motor

Designed and built a brushless DC motor. Used SolidWorks to CAD an assembly which I then fabricated. Laser cut the acrylic parts and made my own electromagnets by winding copper wire around a ferrite core. The motor has two main components: a shaft with four permanent magnets and the six electromagnets. The six electromagnets are wired to and controlled by a Raspberry Pi. Using Python, I programmed the electromagnets to sequentially attract and repel the permanent magnets located in the shaft. This causes the motor to spin. 

Below is a diagram of how the motor works. The concentric circles represent the electromagnets while the red cross represents the permanent magnets on the shaft. The pink text represents the electromagnet changing polarity. Each permanent magnet is both attracted and repelled by the neighboring electromagnets which cause the shaft to rotate.

## Smart Mirror

Designed and built a Smart Mirror. A Smart Mirror is a concealed screen which displays behind a one-way mirror. The design makes the image float in space without borders. This is similar in concept to the TV screens mounted behind mirrors in fancy hotel bathrooms. My Smart Mirror comprises of a Raspberry Pi enabled computer monitor mounted behind a one-way mirror. I CAD designed the assembly on Onshape, a cloud-based CAD software.

From there, I fabricated the wooden housing and created the one-way mirror using glass and a film. I discretely mounted the monitor within the wooden frame using custom 3D printed fixtures.

## Sand Sifter

Designed and built a bike-powered sand sifter. My friend and I built the device out of my garage using an array of hand held power tools. We sourced recycled material – an old bike, a wooden pallet, and scrap wood – to build with. The sand sifter consists of a bike-powered rotating mesh barrel mounted on a platform. The user shovels in sand into the machine, and as the barrel rotates, clean sand falls through the mesh while trash goes out the other end. The bike-sifter assembly disassembles and is portable.  

### Education

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bmorioka/branden.morioka.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
